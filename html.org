* basics
  HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
  A markup language is a set of markup tags.
  HTML documents are described by HTML tags.
  Each HTML tag describes different document content.

  The text between <HTML> and </HTML> describes an HTML document.
  The text between <head> and </head> provides information about the document.
  The text between <body> and </body> describes the visible page content.

  HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets.

  The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to
  display the document.

  The <!DOCTYPE> declaration helps the browser to display a web page correctly.
  To display a document correctly, the browser must know both type and version.
  The doctype declaration is not case sensitive.

  HTML tags are not case sensitive.
* HTML element
  HTML documents are made up by HTML elements.

  HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content
  in between.
  The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
  Some HTML elements do not have an end tag.
  HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).
  All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

  The *<HTML>* element defines the *whole document*.
  It has a *start* tag <HTML> and an *end* tag </HTML>.
  The element *content* is another HTML element.

  HTML elements with not content are called *empty elements*.
  Empty element can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.
* HTML attributes
  HTML elements can have attributes.
  Attributes provide additional information about an element.
  Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
  Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value".

* HTML Display
  With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines
  in your HTML code.
  The browser will remove extra spaces and extra lines when the page is
  displayed.
  Any number of spaces, and any number of new lines, count as only one space.
* HTML Styling
  Every HTML element has a default style.
  Changing the default style of an HTML element, can be done with the *style*
  attribute.
  
  The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:
    style="property:value"
  The *property* is a CSS property. The *value* is a CSS value.
