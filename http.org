* Why redirects?
  Redirection is a fact of life in the modern Web because HTTP applications
  always want to do three things:

  + Perform HTTP transaction reliably
  + Minimize delay
  + Conserve network bandwidth

  For these reasons, web content often is distributed in multiple locations.
  This is done for reliability, so that if one location fails, another is
  avaiable.
  It is done to lower response time, because if clients can access a nearer
  resource, they receive their requested content faster.
  It is done to lower network congestion, by spreading out target servers.

  You can think of redirection as a set of techniques that help to find the
  "best" distributed content.
