** INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
   If you specify *ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE* , and a row is inserted that would
   cause a duplicate value in a UNIQUE index or PRIMARY KEY, an UPDATE of the
   old row is performed. For example, if column a is declared as UNIQUE and
   contains the value 1, the following two statements have identical effect:

   INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3)
   ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=c+1;

   UPDATE table SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1;

   The ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause can contain multiple column assignments,
   separated by commas.

   With ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, the affected-rows value per row is 1 if the row
   is inserted as a new row, and 2 if an existing row is updated.
