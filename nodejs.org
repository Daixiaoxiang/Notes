* node 概述
  Node is designed to be used for applications that are heavy on I/O, but light
  on computation.
  
  Node 中的 I/O 都是异步的.

  Node is implemented on a single thread.

  Node doesn't create a new thread or process for every request. Instead, it
  listens for specific events, and when the event happens, responds
  accordingly. Node doesn't block any other request while waiting for the event
  functionaility to complete, and events are handled -- firstcome, first
  serverd -- in a relatively uncomplicated *event loop* .

  对上述的总结:
  Node.js is a server-side technology that's based on Google's V8 JavaScript
  engine. It's a highly scalable system that uses 
  *asynchornous, event-driven I/O* ,rather than threads or separate processes.
  It's ideal for web applications that are 
  *frequently accessed but computationally simple* .
