* Docstring and Comments
  _Docstring_ explains *how* to use code, and are for the users of your
  code. Use of docstrings:
  + Explain the purpose of the function even if it seems obvious to you, because
    it might not be obvious to someone else later on.
  + Describe the parameters expected, the return values, and any exceptions raised.
  + If the method is tightly coupled with a single caller, make some mention of
    the caller (though be careful as the caller might change later).

  _Comments_ explain *why*, and are for the maintainers of your code. Examples
  inlcude notes to yourself, like:

  + # !!! BUG: ...
  + # !!! FIX: This is a hack
  + # ??? Why is this here?

  NOTE:
  False comments & docstrings are worse than none at all. So keep them up to
  date! When you make changes, make sure the comments & docstrings are
  consistent with the code, and don't contradict it.
