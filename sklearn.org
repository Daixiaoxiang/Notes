* 是否存在类似 R 中的 summary 函数对 model 的效果进行评估
  没有.

  There exists no R type regression summary report in sklearn. 
  The main reason is that sklearn is used for predictive modelling/machine
  learning and the evaluation criteria are based on performance on previously
  unseen data (such as predictive r^2 regression).

  There does exist a summary function for classification called 
  *sklearn.metrics.classification_report* which calculates serveral types of
  (predictive) scores on a classification model.

  For a more classic statistical approach, use *statsmodels* .
