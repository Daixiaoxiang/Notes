* `union` 和 `union all` 区别
  *union all* 不会对结果进行去重，*unicon all* 会对结果去重.
  另外，*union* 会比 *union all + distinct* 的效率还高.
  
  Note:
  + Hive 目前不支持 *union* ，只支持 *union all* .

* foreign key
  A FOREIGN KEY in one table points to a PRIMARY KEY in another table.

  FOREIGN KEY 的作用:
  + prevent actions that would destroy links between tables
  + prevent invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column,
    because it has to be one of the values contained in the table it points to
